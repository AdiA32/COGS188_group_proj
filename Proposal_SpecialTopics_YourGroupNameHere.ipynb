    "# Topic and Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Topic\n",
    "Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze data points collected and ordered over time. It's used in various fields such as economics, finance, and weather forecasting. **Models** are also used to make predictions and identify patterns within the data and will be talked about like ARIMA, CNN, RNN etc. See outline. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Data:** Time series data consists of observations or measurements taken at intervals over time. Each data point is associated with a specific time index. Examples include stock prices, temperature readings, sales figures, and sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals for Students\n",
    "- Students will be able to understand the various components of Time Series.\n",
    "- Students will be able to describe simple forecasting models.\n",
    "- Students will be able to identify a stationary time series.\n",
    "- Students will be able to develop a basic understanding of ARIMA Models.\n",
    "- Students will be able to understand CNNs and RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of the Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components of Time Series:\n",
    "- Trend\n",
    "- Seasonal Variations\n",
    "- Cyclic Variations\n",
    "- Random or Irregular Movements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Forecasting Models:\n",
    "- Average Method\n",
    "- Naive Method\n",
    "- Seasonal Naive Method\n",
    "- Exponential Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Stationary and Non-Stationary Univariate Time Series\n",
    "**Resources:**\n",
    "- Google stock price for 200 consecutive days\n",
    "- Daily change in the Google stock price for 200 consecutive days\n",
    "- Annual number of strikes in the US\n",
    "- Monthly sales of new one-family houses sold in the US\n",
    "- Annual price of a dozen eggs in the US (constant dollars)\n",
    "- Monthly total of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia\n",
    "- Annual total of lynx trapped in the McKenzie River district of north-west Canada\n",
    "- Monthly Australian beer production\n",
    "- Monthly Australian electricity production\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Models\n",
    "- **AR: Autoregression**  \n",
    "  A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of its own past values.\n",
    "- **I: Integrated**  \n",
    "  Using differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "- **MA: Moving Average**  \n",
    "  A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CNNs vs. RNNs\n",
    "**CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks):**\n",
    "- Good at feature extraction from fixed-length inputs, which can be helpful for time series data with consistent lengths.\n",
    "- Computationally efficient due to their ability to leverage parallel processing, especially when GPU acceleration is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):**\n",
    "- Designed specifically to model sequential data by maintaining an internal state, allowing them to capture dependencies across time steps for historical context.\n",
    "- Less efficient computationally compared to CNNs, particularly during training, due to their sequential nature, which limits parallelization."
